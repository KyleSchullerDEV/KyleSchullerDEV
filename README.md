# KyleSchullerDEV

Hey, my name is Kyle, I'm a frontend dev. I love animation and styling, I'm a pixel-perfectionist and I'm passionate about accessibility, semantics and just doing things right, you know?

I can do a whole bunch form vanilla HTML, CSS and JS (no frameworks) to React, Next.js, HubL (HubSpot's templating language forked from Jinja) and more. The current day job keeps me pretty separate from the rest of the dev community but side hustles and contracting gigs involve collaboration and using the latest technologies like genrative AI, Next.js App Router, Framer Motion & GSAP, and more.
